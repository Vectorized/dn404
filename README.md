DN404 is an implementation of a co-joined ERC20 and ERC721 pair.

- Full compliance with the ERC20 and ERC721 specifications.
- Transfers on one side will be reflected on the other side.
- Pretty optimized.

## Safety

This is **experimental software** and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

We **do not give any warranties** and **will not be liable for any loss** incurred through any use of this codebase.

While DN404 has been heavily tested, there may be parts that exhibit unexpected emergent behavior when used with other code, or break in future Solidity versions.

Please always include your own thorough tests when using DN404 to make sure it works correctly with your code.

## Upgradability

Most contracts in DN404 are compatible with both upgradeable and non-upgradeable (i.e. regular) contracts.

Please call any required internal initialization methods accordingly.
